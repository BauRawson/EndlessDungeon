Game tutorial–because obviously it’s missing:
1. Inventory: Slots on the right
2. Equipment: Slots on the left
3. Enemies might drop items on the floor. When approaching the item with the Player we can click it to pick it up.
4. There are three types of items:
	Equipment: We drag these to the Equipment slots to increase player stats.
	Consumable: We drag these to the Player character (on screen) to heal him.
	Enhancer: We drag these to other Equipment items to enhance them permanently.
5. Player auto-attacks enemies when nearby, as long as its walking in the enemy’s direction or standing still.
